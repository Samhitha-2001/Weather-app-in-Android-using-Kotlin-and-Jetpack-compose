This is a weather application built in Android Studio, using Kotlin and Jetpack compose
The app fetches weather and forecast from the openweather api (https://home.openweathermap.org/).

The app asks the user permission to access the devices location on  startup, once provided the weather and forecast data for the current location is loaded.
